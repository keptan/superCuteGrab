sorry for all thet hassle, you might want to just wait for a release version to eventually appear because this shit is pretty retarded lol 


git clone --recursive -submodules https://github.com/keptan/superCuteGrab
cd superCuteGrab
make a saucenao account https://saucenao.com
touch saucenao_key
echo 'your_saucenao_api_key' >> saucenao_key

if you buy a upgraded 30 day pass or whatever you can leave the code as it is
otherwise you have to go to src/booru.cpp and change the ratelimit on line 285
right now its 25 3000 which means 25 requests per 30000 milliseconds
i dont even remember what the default is, so youll have to go check on https://saucenao.com/user.php?page=search-usage here and find out

cmake .
make
mkdir thumbnails
mkdir data
mkdir db

./cutegrab -scan directory
recursively scans the directory for images, reverse imagae searches them on danbooru, saucenao, and gelbooru
adds tags to a csv

./cutegrab -gui
opens the gui
use 'import recurse' to import images from a folder that you've previously tagged
double click on a thumbnail to open the ranking window
itll show you two images

left arrow - left image is cuter
right arrow - right image is cuter
up arrow - equally cute
down arrow - fix the image scales (LOL) (youll see why)

you can right click on a thumbnail and view the info 
or delete an image from your filesystem

search for tags in the searchbar thing or click on a tag and click 'filter by selected'
you can sort the images with the sorting thing at the bottom
